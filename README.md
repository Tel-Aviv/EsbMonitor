# EsbMonitor

## How to build

1. This project depends on the <a href="https://github.com/Tel-Aviv/EsbGQLServer">GraphQL Server for TLV ESB</a>, i.e. it's the GraphQL client; so before you run this project, download, build and run its counterpart. Optionally, you may ajust the address of GraphQL server in <code>Environment.js</code>.

2. Some capabilities of this project won't work without direct on connection to Elastic host. Please, adjust Elastic host address in <code>elastic/connection.js</code> file.

When you are done with GraphQL Server and Elastic,
1. git pull, <code>$ npm i</code> (under Windows, try <code>$ npm i --no-optional</code>) to install all dependencies
2. <code>$ yarn relay</code> to compile graphql templates. This will issue introspection query aganst running GrphQL server, so make sure GraphQL Server for TLV ESB is running at time of executing this script. If needed, adjust graphql endpoint URL passed as a parameter to the <code>getSchema</code> script.
3. Point Web Server for Chrome or IIS to file system folder to host <code>index.html</code>
4. <code>$ yarn build</code> to create <code>bundle.js</code> referenced in <code>index.html</code>
